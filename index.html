                <div class="slide__text">“Do yourself a tremendous favour and go to a record store today. The relatively
                    mild exertion of
                    getting off your fat, computer-shackled ass and venturing out to find the object of your desire, the
                    thrill of moving through actual space and time, through row upon row of records, and the tactile
                    ecstasy of fondling the quested treasure—all this will augment and enrich the mental associations
                    the music invokes in you for the rest of your life.”</div>

                    you don’t really own the album. And it’s not just me or a little pet thing or some kind of retro
                    romantic thing from the past. It is still alive.”</div>

                    set up at home with a hi-fi and really nice turntable and it’s a big deal to me to listen to music
                    in it’s purest form like that.”</div>

                <div class="slide__text">“My father was my first inspiration. He had an incredible stereo and a
                    turntable, and I was told not to touch it. But I’d go back and touch it anyway. I gained a respect
                    for the turntables when I was a kid. When I was a teenager, I came up with a ‘cueing system’ to work
                    the turntables because they didn’t have it at that time.”</div>

                <div class="slide__text">“Ever since I was 12 years old, when my fascination and obsession with music
                    started, I would get on my skateboard and ride down to the local record store. I’d find the most
                    tattooed guy there and have him recommend me a new album once a week. Then I’d learn it and play it
                    on my drums. I would HATE for kids to be deprived of the incredible experience of discovering music
                    through their
                    local record stores. Lets keep record stores alive and well, please.””</div>
